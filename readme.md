This requires the Nintaco emulator to run, as well as an original Pac-Man NES ROM.
The Nintaco software and library we included is available under the
https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.en.html license, and we have
modified it so that it can be used without necessarily invoking an infinite loop.

Start the Nintaco emulator, load the Pac-Man ROM, and run main.py.
